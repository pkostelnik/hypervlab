# LAB on local Hyper-V

based on Windows 11 (should also work on Windows 10)

## Basic preparation

You need a "powerful" machine as Hyper-V Host:

* CPU: Intel I5/7/9 or AMD Ryzen 5/7/9
* Memory (RAM) 32 GB ++
* SSD around 1024 GB ++

If you are choosing/building a new one, do not spend too much on CPU, Memory is way the better way for better performance with more then 4 VM's.

Next you need to have Windows 11/11 Pro++ installed on it including the Hyper-V role.
Being able to install VM's you need also some ISO Files for each System you wanna include in your LAB:
some of them are available at: <https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/evalcenter/>

the other way is to download the products from your visualstudio subscription: <https://my.visualstudio.com/Downloads/Featured> as long you own one.

Here you will find some usefull PowerShell scripts, which will make a LAB deployement on Hyper-V (local) faster and hopefully also easier.

## Prerequisites
### VHDX

The script buids a new VM based on differentiating VHDX File(s), so you need to create one VM Manually and Sysprep the system after updating it to the latest time.

sysprep location: 
`systemdrive:\windows\system32\sysprep`

sysprep command:
`sysprep /oobe /generalize /shutdown`

options meaning:
- oobe = (re)activate Out-of-Box-Experience
- generalize = remove any GUID/UUID and such uniq identifiers
- shutdown = Shutdown the VM after sysprep cleanup

### Scripts included from 23.09.2022

* VM Prepopulation (Working on GUI and automation)
* Install and Setup AD
* rename and domainjoin VM
* install all prerequisites for office online server
* create ISO file from folder
* Exchange Server prerequisites

## Variables used in the scripts (which should be selfexplaining) ðŸ¤“ðŸ˜Ž

| Variable | meaning |
|--|--:
|$VMPrefix = ""| used to set mark (VMname, Network and so on) in case of more then one lab |
|$VMSwitchName = ""| building the new virtual switch name |
|$VMPath = ""| where to save the whole VM data|
|$ISOPath = ""| Where is your path to the ISO files|
|$ISO = ""| Windows iSO name|
|$sfbiso = ""| Skype for Business Server iSO name|
|$exiso = ""| Exchange Server iSO name|
|$sqliso = ""|SQL Server iSO name |
|$oosiso = ""|Office Online Server iSO name |
|$ex13iso = ""| Exchange Server 2013 ISO name |
|$ex16iso = ""| Exchange Server 2016 ISO name |
|$ex19iso = ""| Exchange Server 2019 ISO name |
|$sp16iso = ""| SharePoint Server 2016 ISO name |
|$sp19iso = ""| SharePoint Server 2019 ISO name |
|$spseiso = ""| SharePoint Server SE ISO name |
|$ParentPath = ""| where to find your prepared Windows Server 2019 vhdx file |
|$Parentws16 = ""| where to find your prepared Windows Server 2016 vhdx file |
|$Parentws22 = ""| where to find your prepared Windows Server 2022 vhdx file |
|$VMList = ""| all of your VM machines list|
|$VM = ""| temporary variable for vm creation|

The Preparation script is easy to be enhanced for more then the predefined number of VM's. In the same way you can also add your ISO Files for the staging.
